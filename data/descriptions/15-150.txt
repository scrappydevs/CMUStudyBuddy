Course Name: 15-150: Functional Programming, Fall 2025

================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this course is to introduce the theory and practice
      offunctional programming (FP). The characteristic feature of
      FP is the emphasis oncomputation as evaluation.
      The traditional distinction between program and data characteristic ofimperative programming (IP)is replaced by an emphasis on
      classifying expressions bytypesthat specify their applicative behavior.
      Types include familiar (fixed and arbitrary precision) numeric types,
      tuples and records (structs), classified values (objects), inductive
      types such as trees, functions with specified inputs and outputs, and
      commands such as input and output. Well-typed expressions are evaluated to produce
      values, in a manner that is guaranteed to be type-safe. Because functional programs do not cause side-effects
      we can take advantage of simple mathematical principles in reasoning about
      applicative behavior and analyzing the runtime properties of programs.
The advantages of FP are significant:
Verification: There is a close correspondence between
        the mathematical reasoning that justifies the correctness of a program and the
        program itself. Principles of proof by mathematical induction go hand-in-hand with
        the programming technique of recursion.Parallelism: Since expressions have no side-effects,
        it is natural to use parallel evaluation:
        the values of independent subexpressions may be determined simultaneously,
        without fear of interference or conflict, and the final result is
        not affected by evaluation order. This gives rise to the central concepts of thework
          (sequential)andspan (idealized parallel)complexity
        of a program, and allows programs to exploit available parallelism
        without fear of disrupting their correctness.Abstraction: FP stressesdata-centriccomputation, with operations that act on compound data structures as
        whole, rather than via item-by-item processing. More generally, FP
        emphasizes the isolation ofabstract typesthat clearly
        separateimplementationfrominterface. Types are
        used to express and enforce abstraction boundaries, greatly enhancing
        maintainability of programs, and facilitating team development.
Moreover, FP generalizes IP by treating commands as forms of data
      that may be executed for their effects.

      mastery of basic functional programming techniques, including the
      design of programs using types, the development of programs using
      mathematical techniques for verification and analysis, the use of
      abstract types and modules to structure code, and the exploitation
      of parallelism in applications.In particular, a student taking this course will learn to:Write well-typed functional programs using the language MLDevelop specifications and prove program correctness using rigorous techniquesApply equational, evaluational, and compositional reasoning techniques, and use mathematical and structural
        induction in proofsAnalyze sequential and parallel running time of programs using the concepts of work and spanDevelop cost graphs and recurrences from programs, and use them to derive asymptotic bounds on work and spanUse abstract types and modules to structure code with clear and well-designed interfacesIdentify opportunities for parallelism in code and exploit parallelism by choosing appropriate data
        structures and function designsPrerequisites:Prerequisite courses are (15-151 or 21-127 or 21-128) and
    (15-112 or 15-122).Students should also have some basic mathematical background,
      such as the ability to do a proof by mathematical induction, in
      order to reason about program correctness. In addition, it will
      be very useful for a student to have developed abstraction skills
      and to have familarity with the core mathematical structures of
      Computer Science, such as sets, relations, graphs, and trees.Successful completion of this course is necessary and sufficient for
      entry into 15-210 Data Structures and Algorithms, which will build on
      the functional model of computation to develop a modern account of
      parallel algorithms for a wide variety of abstract types.Note to StudentsTake care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle
      this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol,
      getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help
      you achieve your goals and cope with stress.All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not
      alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an
      important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help.
      Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life
      events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to
      seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help:
      call 412-268-2922 and visit their website athttp://www.cmu.edu/counseling/.
      Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for
      help getting connected to the support that can help.The university is technically required by federal law to not discriminate
      on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability,
      age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief,
      veteran status, or genetic information. Therefore, the university is
      obligated to encourage anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile
      treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support,
      within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone
      can share these experiences using the following resources:Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion:csdi@andrew.cmu.edu,
