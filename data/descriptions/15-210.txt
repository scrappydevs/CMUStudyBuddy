OVERVIEW:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15-210 aims to teach methods for designing, analyzing, and programming
    sequential and parallel algorithms and data structures. The emphasis is on
    teaching fundamental concepts applicable across a wide variety of problem
    domains, and transferable across a reasonably broad set of programming
    languages and computer architectures. This course also includes a
    significant programming component in which students will program concrete
    examples from domains such as engineering, scientific computing, graphics,
    data mining, and information retrieval (web search).
Unlike a traditional
    introduction to algorithms and data structures, this course puts an emphasis
    onparallel thinking— i.e., thinking about how algorithms
    can do multiple things at once instead of one at a time. The course follows
    up on material learned in 15-122 and 15-150 but goes into significantly more
    depth on algorithmic issues. Concepts covered in this class include:
Problem vs. AlgorithmAproblemdefines an interface while analgorithmdefines a particular method to solve the problem. For example, quicksort
        is an algorithm to solve the sorting problem. Being able to cleanly define
        a problem is key in the process of putting together large programs and in
        reusing their components.Asymptotic AnalysisIn this class, we analyze performance in terms of work,
        span, and space usingbig-Oanalysis. We cover a variety of
        techniques for analyzing asymptotic performance including solving
        recurrences, randomized analysis, and various counting arguments.Techniques in Algorithm DesignWe cover techniques that play a key role in the design of most algorithms
        and data structures, including: collections (sets, sequences, priority
        queues, ...), divide-and-conquer, contraction, the greedy method,
        balanced trees, hashing, sparse matrices, and dynamic programming.
The development of this course was supported in part by generous gifts from
  Intel's Higher Education Program, Microsoft Research, and IBM Research.
