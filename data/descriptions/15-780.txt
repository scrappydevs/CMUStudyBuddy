This course provides a broad perspective on AI, with a focus on foundational principles powering modern AI. This course will first build towards what is now colloquially refered to asAIin current days: large language models and generative AI. We will then study classical AI topics of search, reinforcement learning, and game theory to provide a well-rounded understanding of how AI systems can reason, learn, and make decisions. The course will explore the connections between these classical techniques and modern AI approaches, highlighting how foundational ideas have evolved and influenced current advancements. Through a combination of lectures offering a mathematical perspective, hands-on assignments, and discussions, students will gain insights into both the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementations of AI systems. Topics such as ethical considerations, robustness, and limitations of AI will also be addressed to encourage critical thinking about the role of AI in society.

          (programming assignments will be given in Python), as well as some general CS background. Please see the
          instructors if you are unsure whether your background is suitable for the course.There is no formal textbook for the course. Lectures will provide references to readings as appropriate.Office HoursNameEmailHoursAditi Raghunathanaditirag@cs.cmu.eduMondays 3.30 pm - 4.30 pm (while walking from class to GHC 7005 and then at GHC 7005)Lingjing Konglingjink@cs.cmu.eduWednesdays 3:30 pm - 4:30 pm (GHC 9115)Chen Wuchenwu2@cs.cmu.eduTuesday 4:00 pm - 5:00 pm (GHC 9115)Schedule (Subject to change)Homework ScheduleHWRelease dateDue dateHomework 11/131/20Homework 21/272/10Homework 32/112/25Project Proposal2/183/24Homework 43/123/26Homework 54/85/2Project Report4/85/2Lecture ScheduleDateTopicSlidesReadings1/13IntroductionLecture 1Chapter 1 of "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach", 4th edition, by Russell and Norvig.The bitter lesson2018 ACM Turing Award1/15Supervised machine learning - 1Lecture 21/20No class (MLK day)1/22Supervised machine learning - 2Lecture 31/27Optimization - 1Lecture 4&51/29Optimization - 2Lecture 4&52/3Optimization  - 3Lecture 6An overview of gradient descent algorithms2/5Neural networks - 12/10Neural networks - 2Lecture 7&82/12Pytorch review2/17Transformers and LLMs -1Lecture 9Annotated Transformer2/19Transformers and LLMs - 2Lecture 102/24Midterm review2/26Mid term3/3No class (spring break)3/5No class (spring break)3/10No class3/12Scaling laws and emergent capabilitiesLecture 113/17Inference-time methods to searchLecture 123/19Search - 2Lecture 133/24(No class)3/26MDPsLecture 14a3/31RL - 1Lecture 14b4/2RL - 2Lecture 154/7RL and language models4/9TBD4/14Guest lecture on ethics/privacy/security4/16Guest lecture on diffusion models4/21Poster Presentation4/23No classHomework AssignmentsThere will be five assignments: they will involve both written answers and programming assignments. Written
          questions will involve working through algorithms presented in the class, deriving and proving mathematical
          results, and critically analyzing the material presented in class. Programming assignments will involve
          writing code in Python to implement various algorithms presented in class.Instructions for submitting homework will be added soon.Homework PoliciesYou can use no more than3 late daysper assignment and no more than a total of8 late daysover the semester. These late days can and should be used in the event that something comes up that you
              did not plan for. You do not need to notify the course staff if you plan to use them. No credit will be
              given for assignments submitted more than 3 days (72 hours) after the posted deadline.You can discuss both the programming and written portions with other students, but all final submitted
                work (code and writeups) must be done entirely on your own, without looking at any notes generated
                during group discussions. Be sure to mention your collaborators' names and Andrew IDs in your
                writeup. The use of generative AI tools is allowed, but you are expected to exercise your own judgment and ensure that you fully understand the required concepts through your engagement with the assignments.Can search the internet for references but you are not allowed to post the questions on stackoverflow or
              anywhere else.If you reference any code or sources other than the materials provided on the course website or the
              textbook, you must mention the source. If you have any questions about whether or not you can use a
              source, please ask.Course projectThe course project can be completed in groups of 2-3 students and may explore any topic that is at least loosely related to the themes covered in the course. Detailed guidelines and timelines are providedhere.Accommodations for Students with DisabilitiesIf you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, we encourage
          you to discuss your accommodations and needs with us as early in the semester as possible. We will work with
          you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability
          and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, we
          encourage you to visit theirwebsite.Statement of Support for Students’ Health & Well-beingTake care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
          getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with
          stress.All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus
          and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner
          rather than later is almost always helpful.If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
          depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to
          help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website athttp://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend,
          faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.If you have questions about this or your coursework, please let us know. Thank you, and have a great semester.Statement of Commitment to a Diverse Learning EnvironmentWe must treat every individual with respect.We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is
          fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to
          multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language,
          sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status,
          or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the
          perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity,
          equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue
          justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our
          classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core
          values.Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They
          contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the
          university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity
          to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed.
          Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150Report-It online anonymous reporting platform:reportit.netusername: tartans password: plaidAll reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions.
          Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to
          be more equitable and just.
