DESCRIPTION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15-411 Compiler DesignThis course covers the design and implementation of compiler and
runtime systems for high-level languages, and examines the interaction
between language design, compiler design, and runtime
organization. Topics covered include lexical and syntactic analysis,
type-checking, program analysis, code generation and optimization,
memory management, and runtime organization.PiazzaFor student without Piazza access fill out your andrew id inthis formLecturesTue/Thu 09:30AM – 10:50AM (ET)In-person atDHA302Instructors:Seth GoldsteinandBen TitzerRecitationsRecitation A: Fri 1:00 - 1:50 PM (ET) atGHC::4102Recitation B: Fri 2:00 - 2:50 PM (ET) atBH::235ARecitation C: Fri 4:00 - 4:50 PM (ET) atWEH::5312Recitation D: Fri 1:00 - 1:50 PM (ET) atGHC::4301Office HoursIn-person, see Google Calendar andstaff pagefor schedule.Course CalendarLearning ObjectivesDistinguish the main phases of a state-of-the-art compilerUnderstand static and dynamic semantics of an imperative languageDevelop parsers and lexers using parser generators and combinatorsPerform semantic analysisTranslate abstract syntax trees to intermediate representations and static single assignment formAnalyze the dataflow in an imperative languagePerform standard compiler optimizationsGenerate efficient assembly code for a modern architectureAllocate registers using a graph-coloring algorithmUnderstand opportunities and limitations of compiler optimizationsAppreciate design tradeoffs how representation affects optimizationsAutomatically manage memory using garbage collectionDevelop complex software following high-level specificationsPlease see the calendar for the lecture topics and links to the
